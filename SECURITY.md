## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you think you have discovered a security issue in the SORA docs, please let us know. 
We take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it as soon as possible and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and crediting the discoverer. 
To report a security issue, send the description of the flaw and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps, version) to [sora@soramitsu.co.jp](mailto:sora@soramitsu.co.jp).
