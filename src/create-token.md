# How to Create a Token on the SORA Network

## TL;DR
- This guide provides a step-by-step process for creating tokens on the SORA network, ensuring a smooth and straightforward experience.
- As a decentralized network, SORA invites everyone to participate in the growth of the new economy, and creating a new token is one of the many ways to get involved.

## Connect Your Wallet

Before creating a new token, you need to connect your crypto wallet with Polkaswap. Please follow the instructions on this page: [Connect Your Wallet to Polkaswap](./polkaswap-connect-wallet.md)

Alternatively, you can create an account and wallet on the SORA network using your Google account. Instructions for this process are available here: [Connect With Google](./polkaswap-connect-with-google.md)

## Create a New Token

Open the Account page from the menu on the right. In the top-right corner of the central panel, find and click the "Create" button, which is represented by a star icon.

A new panel will appear where you can select your token and enter the required information. Fill in the following details:
- `Token Symbol`: A unique identifier for the token, which can be between 1 and 7 characters.
- `Token Name`: The name of the token, which can be between 1 and 33 characters.
- `Token Supply`: The total number of tokens you will receive upon creation.

::: info
 If you want the option to mint more tokens in the future, enable the **Extensible Supply** toggle. Otherwise, leave it turned off.

Note: Initially, your token might display a question mark instead of an icon, and it may lack additional information. Follow the next steps to address this.
