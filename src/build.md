# Build on SORA
- Developers can receive support to deploy **new and amazing projects on the SORA network**
- New projects that are developed from scratch can receive financial backing in XOR and project incubation, as well as development support
- Projects that already have users on another network can get XOR
  grants to pay for porting the projects to the SORA network, as well
  as development mentorship and advice on how to deploy
  
## Decentralized Development at its Best

SORA is a truly decentralized movement, run by the community and for the community. Everyone is encouraged to actively participate in the development and constant improvement of the network. An example of this is the [RFP development process](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-polkaswap-decentralized-development-process-6df207d7518a), a program that allows users to submit requests for new features and subsequently proposals themselves to add new functions and to the network. Some successful proposals include the [XSTUSD stablecoin](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps/blob/master/open_rfps/XST(USD)%20RFP) and the [Referral Program](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps/blob/master/open_rfps/Referral%20Program%20Proposal) that will soon be released into production.

The SORA Builders Programme is now launching to take the power of decentralization even further, and aid the community to make all their great ideas and suggestions to improve the network a reality. 

## The Two Modalities of the SORA Builders Programme

The SORA Builders Programme is an extension of the [SORA RFP program](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-polkaswap-decentralized-development-process-6df207d7518a) (see also [How to RFP](https://medium.com/sora-xor/how-to-rfp-proposing-new-functionalities-to-polkaswap-and-the-sora-network-4af099b15f75)). The SORA Builders Programme branches out into two modalities, **New Project (Incubation)** and **Existing Project (Port).** As the names imply, this programme will support the implementation and development of new projects, as well as porting existing apps onto the SORA network. 

Both new projects and ports can receive compensation in the form of XOR, as well as development support from the SORA community. Because effectively time and development effort are not free, and in order to uphold the community standards, not everyone who applies will be accepted by the programme.

It is also important to mention that depending on the value added by the project, it may also qualify for [Social Insurance](https://medium.com/sora-xor/social-insurance-for-systematically-important-infrastructure-18a63ef711ca), however, there will be required due diligence and the project will have to prove systematic importance to the community.

It is easy to ask *wot* and *wen* when it comes to development, but *putting your RFP where your complaints are* is not that simple to do. The community has no limitation to what is proposed, however, [*spam](https://youtu.be/duFierM1yDg), CEX requests,* and other off-topic requests will not be considered.

## Participating in the SORA Builders Programme

- To join the SORA Builders Programme, please [fill this
form](https://forms.gle/1cdvKTHLXnBXbMTr9), then go to the [SORA
Builders Telegram channel](https://t.me/sorabuilders) in telegram.

- After you have submitted your proposal, it will be reviewed
  internally and you will be invited to talk to the developers, if it
  is a match, the process will continue.
  
  - **Milestones** Funding support provided by the SORA Builders
  Programme is subject to the completion of milestones presented
  within the proposal. 
  - **Developer Support** Depending on the milestones, your team can
    request support from the developers to help porting or building
    their project within the SORA network.
	- **Co-Marketing** Part of the support provided from the SORA
  Builder's Programme includes amplification of the project in the
  SORA Ecosystem Updates and on SORA social media channels.
  
- **Graduation** Once your project is live on SORA, you will be part
  of the elite SORA Builders Graduates. This doesn't mean that the
  support provided will be over. You can still reach out to the tech
  team for any support required. Additionally, if your proejct
  qualifies and you chose to sign up
  for Social Insurance for [Systemically Important Infrastructure
  ](social-insurance.md), the governance of your app will be delegated
  to the SORA Parliament. 


## Time to #Buidl

**The fate of the SORA network lies in the hands of its users!** SORA
governance does not limit the use of the network to the desires of one
entity, but rather, it empowers users and community members to improve
the network as much as they want through the implementation of
programs like [**RPF
submissions**](https://medium.com/sora-xor/how-to-rfp-proposing-new-functionalities-to-polkaswap-and-the-sora-network-4af099b15f75)
and the **SORA Builders Programme**. Progress from both these
initiatives will be reported in the fortnightly **Ecosystem Updates**
and all the submissions, as well as RFP and merged implementations,
are publicly accessible in the **[SORA RFP Github
Repository](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps)** which ensures that
full transparency and decentralized practices are always upheld.
