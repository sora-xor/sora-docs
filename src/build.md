# Build on SORA

- Developers can receive support to deploy **new and amazing projects on the SORA network**.
- New projects that are developed from scratch can receive financial backing in XOR and project incubation, as well as development support.
- Projects that already have users on another network can get XOR
  grants to pay for porting the projects to the SORA network, as well
  as development mentorship and advice on how to deploy.

## Decentralized Development at its Best

The SORA Builders Programme is now launching to take the power of decentralization even further, and aid the community to make all their great ideas and suggestions to improve the network a reality.

## The Two Modalities of the SORA Builders Programme

The SORA Builders Programme is an extension of the [SORA RFP program](rfp.md). The SORA Builders Programme branches out into two modalities, **New Project (Incubation)** and **Existing Project (Port).** As the names imply, this programme will support the implementation and development of new projects, as well as porting existing apps onto the SORA network.

Both new projects and ports can receive compensation in the form of XOR, as well as development support from the SORA community. Because effectively time and development effort are not free, and in order to uphold the community standards, not everyone who applies will be accepted by the programme.

It is also important to mention that depending on the value added by the project, it may also qualify for [Systemically Important Infrastructure
](social-insurance.md), however, there will be required due diligence and the project will have to prove systematic importance to the community.

It is easy to ask _wot_ and _wen_ when it comes to development, but _putting your RFP where your complaints are_ is not that simple to do. The community has no limitation to what is proposed, however, _[spam](https://youtu.be/duFierM1yDg)_, _CEX requests_, and other off-topic requests will not be considered.

## Participating in the SORA Builders Programme

To join the SORA Builders Programme, please [fill this
form](https://forms.gle/1cdvKTHLXnBXbMTr9), then go to the [SORA
Builders Telegram channel](https://t.me/sorabuilders) in telegram.

1- **Sign up**: After you have submitted your proposal, it will be reviewed
internally and you will be invited to talk to the developers, if it
is a match, the process will continue.

2- **Milestones**: Funding support provided by the SORA Builders
Programme is subject to the completion of milestones presented
within the proposal.

3- **Developer Support**: Depending on the milestones, your team can
request support from the developers to help porting or building
their project within the SORA network.
4- **Co-Marketing**: Part of the support provided from the SORA
Builder's Programme includes amplification of the project in the
SORA Ecosystem Updates and on SORA social media channels.

5- **Graduation**: Once your project is live on SORA, you will be part
of the elite SORA Builders Graduates. This doesn't mean that the
support provided will be over. You can still reach out to the tech
team for any support required.

Additionally, if your project qualifies and you chose to sign up for Social Insurance for [Systemically Important Infrastructure
](social-insurance.md), the governance of your app will be delegated to the SORA Parliament.

## Time to #Buidl

**The fate of the SORA network lies in the hands of its users!** SORA
governance does not limit the use of the network to the desires of one
entity, but rather, it empowers users and community members to improve
the network as much as they want through the implementation of
programs like [**RPF
submissions**](rfp.md)
and the **SORA Builders Programme**. Progress from both these
initiatives will be reported in the fortnightly **Ecosystem Updates**
and all the submissions, as well as RFP and merged implementations,
are publicly accessible in the **[SORA RFP Github
Repository](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps)** which ensures that
full transparency and decentralized practices are always upheld.

For more information, read the articles _[SORA Decentralized Development Process](decentralised-development-process.md)_, [_How to RFP_](rfp.md), and [_Social Insurance for Systematically Important Infrastructure_](social-insurance.md). To stay in the loop with the latest implementations of the SORA network and Polkaswap, make sure to follow the Ecosystem updates, and finally, to get a taste of what is to come, watch the **[SORA Development Public Request for Proposal (RFP) Process Github Repo](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps)**!
