### Explore the Interface:

You'll see several key components in the Orderbook interface:

- **The Order Book Widget:** Shows all the aggregated orders for a selected pair.
- **Charts:** Shows visual representations of trading activity.
- **Buy and Sell Widgets:** Shows where you'll place your orders.
- **History Widget:** Displays your past trading activities.
- **Market Trades Widget:** Shows all trades for the selected pair.
- **Understanding Charts:** The chart for the selected pair reflects data related to Order Book trading. It does not aggregate liquidity from swaps.

4. **Order Cancellation:** You can cancel your order at any time
   without any fees.

5. **Fees on Order Placement:** You will incur a fee when placing an
   order. The fee amount depends on the price, similar to current
   swap fees.
