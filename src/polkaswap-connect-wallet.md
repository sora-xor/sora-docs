app.

## Polkaswap Web App

2. You will see a list of supported wallet options to connect,
   including an account created on [Google](/polkaswap-connect-with-google.md), [Fearless Wallet](https://fearlesswallet.io),
   Polkadot.js, as well as Wallet Connect and other
   [Polkadot-compatible
   wallets](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/wallets-and-extensions)
   that support SORA.

3. Select the wallet extension installed on your browser. For example, if you are using Fearless Wallet, click on the Fearless Wallet option.
4. A pop-up window will appear from your selected wallet extension,
   asking you to confirm the connection to Polkaswap. Click "Confirm"
   to proceed.
5. If you chose Wallet Connect, a popup with a QR code will appear for
   you to scan with your mobile wallet, otherwise you can copy the link.

3. You can either connect a SORA account or use Wallet Connect. If you
   chose to connect a SORA account, you have the option to create a
   new account directly in the interface or import an existing account
   with your mnemonic phrase or a json file.

::: info
Follow the [Create an Address
flow](/create-an-address.md#via-polkaswap-telegram-application) if you
do not have a SORA address yet, or [restore an existing address](create-an-address.md#restoring-account-from-mnemonic-in-different-applications) if you already have one.

4. If you choose to use Wallet Connect, the interface is very similar
   to the web app, where you can scan the QR or copy the code for your
   wallet.
