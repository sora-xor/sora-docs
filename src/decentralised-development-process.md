# Decentralized Development Process

### Decentralized Development at its Best

SORA is a truly decentralized movement, run by the community and for the community. Everyone is encouraged to actively participate in the development and constant improvement of the network. An example of this is the [RFP development process](/rfp.md), a program that allows users to submit requests for new features, and subsequently, proposals themselves to add new functions and to the network. Some successful merged proposals include the [XSTUSD stablecoin](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps/blob/master/closed_rfps/XSTUSD.md) and the [Referral Program](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps/blob/master/closed_rfps/ReferralProgramProposal.md).

The **SORA Builders Programme** is now launching to take the power of decentralization even further, and aid the community to make all their great ideas and suggestions to improve the network a reality.

## The Two Modalities of the SORA Builders Programme

The SORA Builders Programme is an extension of the [SORA RFP program](/rfp.md). The SORA Builders Programme branches out into two modalities, **New Project (Incubation)** and **Existing Project (Port)**. As the names imply, this programme will support the implementation and development of new projects, as well as porting existing apps onto the SORA network.

Both new projects and ports can receive compensation in the form of XOR, as well as development support from the SORA community. Because effectively, time and development efforts are not free, and in order to uphold the community standards, not everyone who applies will be accepted by the programme.

It is also important to mention that depending on the value added by the project, it may also qualify for [Social Insurance](https://medium.com/sora-xor/social-insurance-for-systematically-important-infrastructure-18a63ef711ca), however, there will be required due diligence and the project will have to prove systematic importance to the community.

It is easy to ask _wot_ and _wen_ when it comes to development, but _putting your RFP where your complaints are_ is not that simple to do. The community has no limitation to what is proposed, however, _[spam](https://youtu.be/duFierM1yDg)_, _CEX requests_, and other off-topic requests will not be considered.

### Time to #Buidl

**The fate of the SORA network lies in the hands of its users!** SORA governance does not limit the use of the network to the desires of one entity, but rather, it empowers users and community members to improve the network as much as they want through the implementation of programs like **RFP submissions** and the **SORA Builders Programme**. Progress from both these initiatives will be reported in the fortnightly **Ecosystem Updates**, and all the submissions, as well as RFP and merged implementations, are publicly accessible in the [SORA RFP Github Repository](https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps) which ensures that full transparency and decentralized practices are always upheld.
