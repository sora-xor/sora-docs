# Identity

SORA allows you to store profile information in order to identify and discover people across the network. It is convenient for users to use the identity and registrar feature.

A tutorial is provided below on how to set up an identity for yourself.

**How to register your address (provide an identity):**

Requirements:

* SORA account
* \~0.005 XOR for fee

Go to the [Polkadot JS Apps pointing at the Sora Mainnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.sora2.soramitsu.co.jp#/accounts) account's tab:

![Step 1: Click on the hamburger menu icon on the account you wish to register an identity to and select "Set on-chain identity"](<.gitbook/assets/image(6).png>)

![Step 2: Register your Identity and click on Set Identity when finished ](<.gitbook/assets/image(15).png>)

Please note that you will have to pay a small XOR transaction for the fee of signing, once it is completed your account should now show an identity!
