# Identity

SORA allows you to store profile information in order to identify and discover people across the network. It is convenient for users to use the identity and registrar feature.

A tutorial is provided below on how to set up an identity for yourself.

## Register an Identity

Requirements:

* SORA account
* ~0.005 XOR to pay the fee

Follow these steps to set up an identity:

1. Go to the [Polkadot JS Apps pointing at the Sora Mainnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.sora2.soramitsu.co.jp#/accounts) account's tab:

2. Click on the hamburger menu icon on the account you wish to register an identity for. Then select "Set on-chain identity":

    Please note that you will have to pay a small XOR transaction fee for signing.

Once the transaction is completed your account will show an identity!
