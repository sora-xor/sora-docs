# EVM Interoperability

The SORA network is connected to the Ethereum mainnet via the [HASHI
Bridge](https://polkaswap.io/#/bridge/). Although currently there is only one network supported (ETH),
the HASHI bridge will also feature connectivity to multiple EVM-based
networks, as well as Substrate networks.

ðŸš§ This chapter is currently under construction as more networks and
upgrades are added to the HASHI bridge. ðŸš§
