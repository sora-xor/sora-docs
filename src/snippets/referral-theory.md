The referral system motivates users to involve new users in the SORA economy. When you invite people, you are the **referrer**. As a referrer, you’ll get 10% of your referral’s network fees. One referrer can have as many referrals as they like. Each referral can have only one referrer.

The referral graph is stored on-chain, so users have to pay network fees for setting the link between referral and referrer. The referrer bonds some XOR, and when a referral joins the network using the referrer’s code, the bond amount is reduced in order to pay fees.
