There are two options where you can add liquidity:

1. If you already have a share in a specific pool, you can click **Add liquidity** on the pool details.
2. If you'd like to provide liquidity to a pool where you don't have a share, then click **Add liquidity** on the Pool page.

The next steps are pretty much the same. If you select the pool where you already have a share, then the token pair will be preselected, otherwise, you should select the tokens by yourself.

1. Select the token pair.

2. Enter the amount of source asset or destination asset.

   ::: info
   If you enter the amount of a source asset, the amount of destination asset will be calculated according to the pool math. If you enter the amount of destination asset, the amount of source asset will be calculated according to the pool math as well.

   Let's describe the parameters:

   - **XOR per VAL** is the price of XOR in VAL tokens if a user will trade using this pool
   - **VAL per XOR** is the price of VAL in XOR tokens if a user will trade using this pool
   - **Network fee** - the fee for processing the transaction
   - **Share of Pool** - the percentage of your tokens in the pool

3. If everything is ok, confirm and sign the transaction.

Now you can see your share of the pool on the Pool page
