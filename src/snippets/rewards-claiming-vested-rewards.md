You can claim **Rewards for Market Makers**, **LP Fees**, **LP Farming Bonus rewards**, and **Rewards for buying from TBC** using [Polkaswap.io](http://polkaswap.io) with your SORA account. Just open the **Rewards** section.

If you have any rewards, they will be displayed with the reason why you are receiving the rewards. Select the rewards that you'd like to claim (_there might be more than one of them_), confirm, and then sign the transaction.

#### Claiming VAL for XOR erc-20 holders

If you'd like to claim vested VAL, because you had XOR erc-20 when the snapshot was made, then you should connect the Ethereum account where you held the XOR erc-20 tokens. Use the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) browser plugin to do this, then click **Connect Ethereum account.**

If PSWAP or VAL tokens are available then you'll be able to claim them.
