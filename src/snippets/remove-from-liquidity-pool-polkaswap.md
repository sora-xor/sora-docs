Once you've provided the liquidity to the pool, you're also able to remove it (_get your tokens back_).

1. Open the Pool page, then open the pool details and click on **Remove liquidity.**

2. Enter the amount of source asset or destination asset to be removed.

   ::: info
   Pay attention, if you enter the amount of source asset, the amount of destination asset will be calculated according to the pool math. If you enter the amount of destination asset, the amount of source asset will be calculated according to the pool math as well.

   You can use the **Amount slider** to select the percentage of liquidity to be removed:
