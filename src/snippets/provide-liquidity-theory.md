To Polkaswap means to exchange (_swap_) tokens on [Polkaswap](https://polkaswap.io/), Polkaswap is a non-custodial, cross-chain AMM DEX protocol for swapping tokens, Polkaswap removes trusted intermediaries and provides the opportunity for faster trading, and Polkaswap also combines multiple liquidity sources under a common liquidity aggregation algorithm, operating completely on-chain, in a trustless and decentralized way.

XYK Pools are managed by the community. Anyone can provide liquidity to any pool. Liquidity pools (XYK pools) are explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cizLhxSKrAc) on the Finemtaics YouTube channel. It's recommended to watch it in order to understand how Pools work in general.

You can provide liquidity in an XYK pool so that users are able to exchange tokens. There are three main cases here:

1. The pool doesn't exist and you'll be the first liquidity provider (LP).
2. The pool exists and you're adding liquidity.
3. You already have a share in the pool and you'd like to remove liquidity.

Every liquidity provider gets PSWAP rewards for providing liquidity. Rewards are the incentive for users to provide liquidity. There are two types of rewards:

- Rewards paid from LP fees
- [LP Farming bonus rewards](https://medium.com/polkaswap/pswap-rewards-1-polkaswap-liquidity-reward-farming-3e045d71509)

Rewards paid from LP fees are distributed every day for each liquidity pool. For example, if you have a share in three liquidity pools, then your rewards that are available to claim will be updated twice a day.

LP Farming bonus rewards are distributed every six hours.

Along with the network fee in XOR, all three cases require an additional fee: liquidity provider fee (LP fee). The LP fee is used to incentivize liquidity providers to supply liquidity in liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are described in this [article](https://medium.com/polkaswap/polkaswap-pools-48b726cf3a71).
