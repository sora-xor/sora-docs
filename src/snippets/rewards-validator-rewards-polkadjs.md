**Important**: when a nominator or the validator himself claims rewards, those are sent to all the accounts that have received a reward, so it is enough that one person claims for everyone. This may be the reason why you often don't see any reward on the website

1. Go to [polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.sora2.soramitsu.co.jp#/staking), click on "Network" and then "Staking". Make sure you are connected to the SORA network, you should see the logo at the top left.

   If there is a staking reward for you to claim, you should see them, as in the screenshot below:

3. Click on "Payout" and then follow the proposed flow.

4. Once completed, sign with the extension as prompted.

::: info
Please note that Polkadot.js supports only one asset for the network, that's why it shows XOR. However, it is actually **VAL**.

::: warning

**Rewards expire** after 84 eras. On **SORA**, that's about 21 days.
