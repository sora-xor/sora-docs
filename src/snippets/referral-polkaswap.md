In the practice section, we'll create a referral link and get rewards.

#### Bond XOR

First of all, XOR should be bonded in order to pay fees for setting up the referrals.

1. Open the **Rewards** section and click **Referral Program.** Initially, you have 0 XOR bonded and 0 Referrals.

2. Click to **XOR Bonded** and then on **Bond more**:

3. Enter the amount to bond. You can enter any amount, but keep in mind that it should be more than the value of a SORA network transaction to pay a fee for the referral.

4. Now you will see XOR bonded, as well as the link that you can share with your referrals. Copy the link and send it to your friends. When they join the network, you’ll see them in the referrals list.

#### Check Referrals and Rewards

If someone joins SORA using your referral link you’ll get this information on the referral screen:

If your referral makes a transaction then you’ll see the reward that you get. You don’t need to claim this reward, as it will be added automatically to your XOR balance.
