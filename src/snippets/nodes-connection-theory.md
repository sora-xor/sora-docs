SORA is a decentralized network. This means that anyone can run a node and send transactions to this node. Anyone is able to run a sync, archive or validator node. The Polkaswap application supports node selection features. To be precise: You can select a node in the Polkaswap user interface without any additional development. You can also specify a custom node, except the predefined application nodes.
