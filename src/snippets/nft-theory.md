The Polkaswap interface has been powered up and non-fungible tokens are available in [Polkaswap](https://polkaswap.io/#/wallet). At the moment, you can only mint and share NFT. Swapping, liquidity and bridging functions are not available yet.

The other item needed is a file to mint. You can use an [IPFS link](https://ipfs.io/) or you can upload the file locally.
