2. The Polkaswap interface will request your password to sign the transaction for your Google account, keeping it as safe as any dApp signer. You can also set Polkaswap to remember your password for fifteen minutes in _[Substrate Style](create-an-address.md#via-polkadot-js-browser-plugin)_.

The same will apply to liquidity provision transactions, both double (_pooling_) and single-sided (_staking_)—as well as Bridge transactions and claiming rewards.
