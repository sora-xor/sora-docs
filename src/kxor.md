# Kensetsu XOR (KXOR)

Kensetsu XOR (KXOR) is a crucial component of the SORA ecosystem, providing a stable and versatile token for users and builders. Here's everything you need to know about KXOR.

## Pegged to XOR

KXOR is pegged to the price of XOR through sophisticated price tools, ensuring a consistent and reliable value

## Usage and Swapping

KXOR can be used to swap for ETH in the XOR-ETH pool, also known as the Chameleon pool.

This feature adds significant liquidity and flexibility for users, allowing them to easily convert KXOR into other valuable assets.

## Overcollateralization and Buy-Back Mechanism

When KXOR is minted, it is overcollateralized by 3% to maintain stability and support the ecosystem.

The overcollateralized 3% is distributed as follows:
- 1% goes towards buying back and burning KEN, similar to other Kensetsu assets.
- 1% is allocated for buying back and burning the Chameleon Token, a new token in the ecosystem.
- 1% is used to buy back and burn TBCD, further stabilizing the tokenâ€™s value

## Integration with PUSSY Tokens

Builders can lock their PUSSY tokens in a Kensetsu vault to mint KXOR.

This process ensures that PUSSY tokens are used productively and enhances the overall utility of the tokens within the ecosystem.

## In summary

By incorporating these features, Kensetsu XOR (KXOR) provides a robust and flexible financial tool that supports the growth and stability of the SORA ecosystem. Whether you are a builder looking to maximize the value of your PUSSY tokens or a user seeking a stable asset with versatile swapping options, KXOR is designed to meet your needs.
