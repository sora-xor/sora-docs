# SORA Tokenomics

In this section you will find all the information on SORA
tokenomics. Starting with the Token Bonding curve, each subsection
will cover the main [SORA economy](sora-economy.md) tokens. It is
important to remember that the [XOR](xor.md) token does not follow
conventional tokenomics of limited supply, instead, its supply is
elastic, tied to the [Token Bonding Curve (TBC)](tbc.md) and managed
through [SORA governance](sora-governance.md).

- The [Token Bonding Curve (TBC)](tbc.md) is the smart contract that
  manages the supply of XOR in a rational way, without the involvment
  of humans.
- [XOR](xor.md) is the network utility token used for transaction fees (gas).
- [VAL](val.md) is the token awarded to validators for securing the
  SORA network.
- [PSWAP](pswap.md) is the LP reward token for liquidity providers on
  [Polkaswap](https://polkaswap.io/) and is burnt with every transaction.
- [XST](xst.md) is the _platform token_ used as the collateral asset for the creation of SORA Synthetics.
- The [Token Bonding Curve Dollar (TBCD)](tbcd.md) is an algorithmic,
  non-synthetic stablecoin that has its value maintained by the SORA
  token bonding curve.
