# PUSSY

 <center><img src=".gitbook/assets/pussy.svg" width="250"></center>

## Introduction

The PUSSY token is a dedicated meme cryptocurrency in the SORA economy aimed at funding and rewarding builders. Its role in the ecosystem is to ensure builders are compensated for their efforts and can convert their earnings into a stable and valuable asset.

## Purpose of PUSSY Tokens

The PUSSY token supports builders working on productive outputs and projects within the SORA ecosystem.

It ensures that builders are fairly compensated for their contributions.

## How Builders Receive PUSSY Tokens

Builders submit invoices detailing their work to the community, usually monthly or based on specific milestones.

The community reviews and votes on these invoices. Once approved, the builders are rewarded with PUSSY tokens.

Currently, this community approval process is the only way to obtain PUSSY tokens.

## Utilizing PUSSY Tokens

Builders can leverage their PUSSY tokens by locking them in a Kensetsu vault.

By doing so, they can mint Kensetsu XOR (KXOR), an overcollateralized token pegged to the price of XOR.

This mechanism provides builders with a stable and valuable asset, enhancing the utility of their earned PUSSY tokens

## Kensetsu XOR (KXOR)

KXOR is minted by locking PUSSY tokens, ensuring that the tokens are put to productive use and helping maintain the stability and value of KXOR.

This system creates a robust financial ecosystem where builders are incentivized to contribute to the communityâ€™s growth and development.
