# On-ramp

## Via Polkaswap

<!-- @include: /snippets/on-ramp-polkaswap.md -->

## Via Gatehub

You can now buy native XOR on Gatehub and send it to your SORA wallet quickly.

### Onboarding

Go to gatehub.net, create an account and do KYC. You should experience a smooth onboarding process. Once you pass this process, you will have an XRPL Wallet (also referred to as Primary Wallet or My Wallet).

Here is a [detailed description of account creation
(registration)](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021318533-Register-a-GateHub-Account)
and a [detailed description of KYC (account verification)](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/4580394613906-Video-verification-process-for-an-individual-account).

referred to as Primary Wallet or My Wallet).

After onboarding, in order to be able to buy XOR for the first time, you need to do the following steps:

- [Create a Hosted Wallet](#create-a-hosted-wallet) (_one-time action for the first FIAT deposit_).
- [Deposit EUR funds](#deposit-eur-funds) using a card or SEPA bank transaction.
- [Set a trustline](#set-a-trustline) (_one-time action for the first FIAT deposit_).
- [Buy XOR with EUR / Exchange your EUR to XOR](#exchange-your-eur-to-xor).
- [Send XOR to your SORA wallet](#send-xor-to-your-sora-wallet)

### Create a Hosted Wallet

The XRPL Wallet (also referred to as Primary Wallet or My Wallet) does not have XOR listed. You will need a Hosted Wallet to access XOR. After your first deposit, you will receive a 10 XRP welcome deposit, covering transaction fees when sending funds. You can not withdraw this welcome deposit.

- In the top left corner of the screen, click on My Wallet (= Primary Wallet).

- Click on + Add Wallet.

- Click on Create Wallet (Hosted).
- Name your wallet.

### Deposit EUR funds

Go to the main screen of this Hosted Wallet and add EUR funds. Follow the straighforward steps.
Here are detailed descriptions to [Top up your
card](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/13805209603474-Card-top-up-EUR)
and make a [SEPA EUR deposit](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/13801036058258-EUR-deposit-SEPA).

::: info
**Be careful**: Before checking deposit instructions (SEPA or CARD), you
need to choose “Hosted Wallet” on the left menu. `Hosted Wallet` and
`Primary/My Wallet` have different message references for SEPA.
:::
In case your EUR deposit arrives in the `Primary`/`My Wallet` section,
this is how to move it to the Hosted Wallet:

1.  First, copy the wallet address of your Hosted wallet (a 9 digit
    number).

2.  Then choose `Primary`/`My Wallet` on the top left

3.  Click on `Send Payment`

4.  Choose `Wallet - Wallet transfer`

5.  Enter your password (and 2FA if enabled)

6.  Paste the Hosted Wallet address (the name of your hosted wallet
    should appear)

7.  Chose EUR and the appropriate amount

8.  Confirm

9.  After confirmation, funds should appear in your Hosted Wallet in a matter of seconds

Take a look at the [detailed
description](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021425613-Send-cryptocurrencies-from-your-wallet)
for more information.

### Set a trustline

After the first fiat deposit arrives, you will not see funds in your
account yet. You will receive an email notification and notice a `10
XRP` welcome deposit in your Primary Wallet.

To get fiat funds to your wallet, you must do the “set a trustline for
Euro—GateHub Crypto” action and wait for some minutes or, in some
cases, until the next working day for EUR funds to appear in your
Hosted Wallet.

Here is a [detailed description](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021430013-Set-and-disable-trust-lines).

### Exchange your EUR to XOR

Once the EUR is received and visible in your Hosted Wallet (received), you can exchange it for XOR under the Exchange tab.

1. Chose “Hosted Wallet” in the top left corner
2. Click on Exchange in the menu on the left
3. Chose EUR on the left and XOR on the right of the screen
4. Chose amount of EUR under “You pay”
5. Click on the “Exchange” button on the right side of the screen

Take a look at the [detailed
description](https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021425773-Exchange) here.
