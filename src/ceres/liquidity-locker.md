# Ceres Liquidity Locker

The [Ceres Liquidity Locker](https://dapps.cerestoken.io/liquidity_locker) is a decentralized application that brings more transparency and security to Polkaswap and the SORA and Polkadot ecosystems.
Project teams can lock their token's liquidity and ensure that it cannot be removed/drained for a determined period, giving investors proof of the project's security and legitimacy.
