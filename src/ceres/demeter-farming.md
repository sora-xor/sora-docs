# Demeter (DEO)

Demeter (DEO) is the native token of the Demeter farming platform and DEO Arena Web3 game. In the Ceres ecosystem, Demeter is the first self-purpose airdrop.

## Farming Platform

The [Demeter Farming](https://farming.deotoken.io/) platform is the first of its kind on the SORA network.
This platform's unique feature is giving the user the ability to farm using the same liquidity in multiple pools.
The platform also provides Farming-as-a-Service, meaning every project can create farming/staking pools without coding.
