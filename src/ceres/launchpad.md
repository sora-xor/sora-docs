# Ceres Launchpad

The [Ceres Launchpad](https://dapps.cerestoken.io/launchpad) is the first station for new projects on the SORA network. 
With Launchpad, new projects can easily launch their tokens on Polkaswap, and users have added security and peace of mind thanks to the Ceres Liquidity Locker, preventing pump and dump schemes.
and Ceres Token Locker are integrated into Launchpad.
